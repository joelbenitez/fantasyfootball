Instructions

1. Go to https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/ and create your app, I put my github URL for both URLS and it was happy, select read/write if you want to add/drop players from
your team (you can always modify that later)

This will give you your consumer key and consumer secret

2. Create the OAuth.json file using the OAuth.template.py file, just input your keys in the appropriate fields. You can't miss it.

Use this: https://yahoo-fantasy-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html as the source of truth, it is missing some stuff but meh, it works fine for the basic stuff

3. Once the OAuth.json file is added, you can start playing with it. Use the League.py file and start playing around. If you figure out something cool please contribute!
